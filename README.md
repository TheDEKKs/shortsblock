# BLOCK YOUTUBE SHORTS
This repository is a YouTube shorts blocker. I created this extension for myself to stop watching youtube shorts. 

# EXTENSION LAUNCH
To run the extension, create a new folder, octrovert it to terminal and type in terminal:  
> git clone https://github.com/TheDEKKs/shortsblock

Then navigate in your browser to
> browser://extensions/

And go into developer mode, after that select the folder you cloned my extension into and download it.
